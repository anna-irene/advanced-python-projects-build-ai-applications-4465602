## Chatbot with Sentiment Analysis

This is a simple terminal-based chatbot that uses sentiment analysis to understand and respond to user emotions. Built with Python and [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/), it simulates empathetic responses based on the mood of the message.

## My Contributions

**Modified File**: `begin/temp/CH_1_NLP_Chatbot.py`  
**Original Version**: `finish/temp/CH_1_NLP_Chatbot.py`

###  Enhancements:
- Added a user-friendly **exit option** to allow quitting with ‚Äúbye‚Äù, ‚Äúexit‚Äù, or ‚Äúquit‚Äù.
- Implemented **empty input handling** so the chatbot prompts the user instead of staying silent.
- Included **manual sentiment override** using predefined positive/negative keyword lists for more accurate emotional responses.

  
## Sample Interaction

```

Sentiment score: -1.0

You: Actually I'm feeling awesome now!
ChatBot: That's great to hear! üòä
